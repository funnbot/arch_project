Given a collection of sites over a large area, models the social network growth between them, using travelling individuals (on-foot) that carry information between settlements. The result of the simulation can be used to predict the most influential sites, the likely allies of a site, and the sites which have the most information flow through them, as they are in the path to connect many sites
