    2013    MayaSim: An Agent-Based Model of the Ancient Maya Social-Ecological System. _Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation_ 16(4):11.

A rather complex agent based model, combining simulations of hydrology, terrain, climate, forest growth, soil, and settlements with trade/trade networks, agriculture, migration, and GDP. The model is applied to the ancient Maya region, and seeks to have it mimic the previously known grown and collapse, and to find what factors attributed most to the formation of The Maya civilization, and finally, to test which variables lead to the simulation becoming unstable and the events that have the most impact. I will be basing my interactive simulation on this paper, reimplementing it in Rust, using the Bevy game engine.
