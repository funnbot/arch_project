- doesn't need to be real research
- doesn't need to model real life
- the ideas in my head show movement
- i want the rain/hydrology simulation from MayaSim
- showing people moving around aswell, even if little dots.
- maybe just adapt mayasim to be people instead of settlements.
## Very generally speaking issues commonly addressed to ABM in archaeological research are
- Socio-ecological dynamics
- Spatial processes
- Culture Change (long-time-perspective)
- Social interaction
	- emergence of social complexity
	- evolution of sociality
	- decision making
### These can be subdivided into
- Identifying drivers of historical change
- Social complexity (e. g. emergence of hierarchies)
- Emergence of centralized decision making
- Population aggregation and abandonment (civilization collapse)
- Emergence of specialization
- Selfishness vs. altruism (e. g. food sharing)
- Response to changing environmental and social conditions
- Impact of ecological stress
- Impact of population aggregation
- System resilience
- Mechanisms of adaptation
- Emergence of territories
- Settlement dynamics
- Site selection
- Resource management
- Land use
- Culture contact
- Maintenance of ethnic boundaries
- Formation of political entities
