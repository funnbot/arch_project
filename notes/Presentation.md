# What it is:
Agent Based Modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling technique used to explore emergent behavior. These models are generally represented by "agents" which can move around as well as interact with their environments. This type of work is part of the field of complexity sciences, which are based around the idea that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts". These "complex systems" as they are known are difficult to model due to the large amount of components all interacting and developing with one another. Agent based modeling is a tool that can help alleviate the complexity of researching these large scale systems, such as societal trends and ecosystems (Premo 2006).
# When it's used:
Agent based modeling has been used for a variety of research across many fields, but Premo states that its most successful usage is in controlled repeatable experiments. Usage of ABMs allow for better studying of emergent behaviors. Where the focus can be on the individual as well as allowing for heterogeneity across a population. ABMs are also good at representing stochasticity (unpredictable) systems and are the only model capable of including spatial typology. The model can be narrowed down to the individual, looking into the aspects of their lives such as location of birth, social interactions, and daily living. It can also be used on a slightly broader scale, referencing things such as cultural patterns, migration and trading between peoples (Premo 2006). 
# Why it's not used:
Although this method is great for those who have the knowledge, many researchers have stated that the barrier for entry is too high for many to use without proper computer science training (Romanowska et al. 2019). Along with the difficulty, some question the verification of the results, as creating these models requires simplifying large sections of data to narrow down aspects to be computable. Archeology as well as other fields are held back by this, as many times there isn't empirical evidence to test and back up a conclusions drawn from an agent based model (Premo 2006). With that being said, as Premo states,
>It is precisely because we as historical scientists do not have access to control groups or to direct informants of what might have been that many of our interpretations stand to benefit from the type of inference-building research that stresses exploration of many possibilities over the emulation of just a few.
>(Premo 2006)

# Yeah but what is it exactly?:
Almost all agent based models will have the same key aspects, "agents" which are simulated singular entities that each have a individual location within a virtual space. The agent will be able to perceive their local environment and then make decisions based on it and other local and global state. There can be multiple types of agents that can all be interacting within one simulation, that all have unique roles, motives, and goals. Most models have an environment represented by a fixed grid of cells to create terrain and other environmental data. On each step of the simulation, a series of algorithms will interpret and modify the agents and the environment, followed by recording the new information about the world for data processing and visualization (Romanowska et al. 2019).
# How its used in Archaeology
Commonly models will utilize real world data, basing the experiment on a specific region. Information imported from GIS can be loaded onto the cell grid, such as elevation, soil characteristics, or rain fall (Heckbert 2013).
Kowarik states that the problems ABM are frequently used for are:
- Socio-ecological dynamics
- Spatial processes
- Culture Change (long-time-perspective)
- Social interaction
	- emergence of social complexity
	- evolution of sociality
	- decision making
 (Kowarik 2012)
# Examples
## Artificial Long House Valley (ALHV)
A model of the population growth and collapse of the Kayenta Anasazi people in Long House Valley, Arizona, who lived there from around 1800 B.C.E to 1300 C.E.. One of the first popular examples of agent-based modeling used in archaeology. The authors stated that ABMs are the best tool for this research due to the bounded topography, and having an in depth reconstruction of climate, crop production, groundwater, flood plain, and human settlements for the region (Axtell et al. 2002).
## TravelerSim
Given a collection of sites over a large area, models the social network growth between them, using travelling individuals (on-foot) that carry information between settlements. The result of the simulation can be used to predict the most influential sites, the likely allies of a site, and the sites which have the most information flow through them, as they are in the path to connect many sites (Graham and Steiner 2006).
## MayaSim
A Model of the civilization growth and collapse of ancient Maya. Heckbert describes it as
“an integrated agent-based, cellular automata, and network model representing the ancient Maya socialecological system. The model represents the relationship between population growth, agricultural production, soil degradation, climate variability, primary productivity, hydrology, ecosystem services, forest succession, and the stability of trade networks. Agents representing settlements develop and expand within a spatial landscape that changes under climate variation and responds to anthropogenic impacts” (Heckbert 2013).
